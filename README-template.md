## My process
For this project, i designed it with mobile/small screens in mind first before considering larger screens. I tried my hand on Taiilwind CSS for this project. The project was built with the use of HTML, Tailwind CSS and vanilla Javascript. CSS flexbos property was used for most of the project.

### What I learned
- how to use the CSS frameowrk i.e Tailwind 

### Continued development
For future projects i'd like to familiarise myself with Tailwind, i found it a bit confusing. 

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me get more information on the installation and use of Tailwind.
